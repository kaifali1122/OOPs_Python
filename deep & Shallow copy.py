# Shallow copy - duplicate object but only copy reference for
#                nested object, so change in nested object affect
#                both copies

# Deep Copy - create a fully independent copy include nested object 
#             so change in nested object does not affect both copies


# Need to import 

# Shallow copy 

# Deep copy
